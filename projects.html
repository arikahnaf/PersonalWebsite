    <h3>Automatic Plant Watering Machine</h3>
    <p>
        A state machine built with Java and Arduino that utilizes a moisture sensor to detect if the soil of 
        the plant is dry. If dry, the machine turns on the water pump and waters the plant until the soil is 
        sufficiently wet.
